# Perspective Landscape Painter (Redesign)

The purpose of this project is to make a map-like interface for exploring perspective maps built from polis-like opinion data.

Demo of work-in-process newer interface: https://main--68c53b7909ee2fb48f1979dd.chromatic.com/iframe.html?globals=&args=&id=components-app--default&viewMode=story

A sub-goal is to allow people to build intuitions about trade-offs of various algorithms and their parameters, during the data processing pipeline.
