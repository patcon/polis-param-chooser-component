# Perspective Landscape Painter (Redesign)

## Current Near-Term

The purpose of this project is to make a map-like interface for exploring perspective maps built from polis-like opinion data.

## Future Medium-Term

A sub-goal is to allow people to build intuitions about trade-offs of various algorithms and their parameters, during the data processing pipeline.
